# GUI to read and project Microcontroller Signal

This project is used to serially read the output signal from a microcontroller board at 9600 BAUD and project it on the canvas. The projected signal can be represented as a Sine, Step or a Ramp signal using the options given on the GUI. The slider allows you to change the max DAC Value (in Volts).
